OK, so by popular demand I have created TiPopover!

## How-To

In the gitub repo is an example app... from that you can see how it works :)

It uses CommonJS so it is easy to add to your app without messing up or stressing over your namespace :)

## ToDo

- Create a real pop-over when on an iPad
- Test / fix android bugs
- Landscape mode

## Where to get it?

I have the code w/sample app uploaded here - [https://github.com/mattapperson/TiPopover/](https://github.com/mattapperson/TiPopover/)

I hope you enjoy TiPopover! Codestrong!
