Title: MakeTi Beta 2: Now deply to device and directly to TestFlight!
Author: Matt Apperson
Date: Jan 23 2012

So after having used MakeTi for a little bit, I decided a couple things were needed... first I was sick of opening Studio when I needed to get the app on my device, and secondly I use TestFlight a lot now and wanted to directly upload my apps.

So I added them!

## How to use the new features

make deploy - Deploy to your iOS device! It will walk you through the process! :)

make deploy testflight=true - Auto upload to testflight!

## PLEASE READ THE README ON GITHUB FOR A MORE ADVANCED HOW-TO!

As always, to get the latest version of MakeTi, just download the latest from the GitHub repo - https://github.com/mattapperson/MakeTi

I hope you enjoy MakeTi Beta 2! Codestrong!
