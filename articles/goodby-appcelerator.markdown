Title: Goodbye Appcelerator
Author: Matt Apperson
Date: Jan 13 2011

I would like to first state that I am saying goodbye to my job at Appcelerator, not to Titanium Mobile. I plan to continue to not only use Titanium, but continue as a Titan. In fact I have some very cool projects I am about to release for those using Titanium Mobile.

That said...

## Why I am leaving...

There are a number of reasons that I am leaving Appcelerator, although only some of which I will be discussing here, or publicly. I am leaving on good terms, and would recommend Appcelerator as an employer.

I am still a strong supporter of the platform and its community. In fact, I plan to continue to promote it as a Titan, and am working on some very cool Open Source projects to extend it, which are due for release soon.

## My thoughts on Titanium having "seen it all"

Titanium is a very cool product and I don't intend to bash it, but below is a list of its main advantages, and the deficiencies that have the potential to be improved:

Pros:
- it's easy to use, after overcoming the learning curve. The current documentation doesn't help - refer to the first item in my list of "Cons"
- it uses JavaScript. I personally think JS is going to play a major roll in the dev world for the next few years
- it is Open Source and extendible
- it is faster to create cross-platform apps compared with developing them natively, and costs less to maintain due to a single codebase

Cons:
- poor APIDocs. However, I know a great deal of work is happening to improve this situation
- certain aspects are a little too "magical" and, as such, make it difficult to hack/fix the core
- Studio sucks! OK, this is obviously subjective; I just don't like eclipse
- Big Brother is watching you! hehe, I just wanted to say that :) Well, it's just that analytics is enabled by default
- it can be bloated, especially on Android. That's just how it is but, to me, it's not that big a deal
- Titanium is currently more of a product that Appcelerator gives away the source code to, than what I personally consider to be an open source "project"

None of these will come as a surprise to anyone who has been using Titanium Mobile. The drawbacks are openly-discussed and, if anything, major problems that people report are often only supported by anecdotal evidence.

The truth is that Appcelerator is a commercial company with investors that made its, and its free software's, existence possible, and so decisions will be made that are unavoidable as a result. No-one can be blamed for that. Besides, having made the software Open Source, the company actually provides the community the autonomy to work around these drawbacks, such as studio or analytics. They can all be easily fixed, as you will see in time! ;)

I know that those problems that remain are being actively worked on by Appcelerator, and I am confident it will succeed.

So, really, all I can say is - I HIGHLY recommend Titanium Mobile!

## OK... here is what I REALLY don't like about Titanium / Appcelerator

The community kinda sucks! That's right, I said it; there are simply not enough people contributing to the Open Source aspects of Titanium. I place the blame for this evenly between Appcelerator and the community itself.

Appcelerator, for its part, pushes tools like the marketplace. There is some VERY cool stuff in there! However, the marketplace is,  as its name suggests, a store. You buy things there; even if the price is free for some of the items, it still does NOTHING to promote Open Source scripts and hacks, which are REALLY needed in the community to help jump-start new developers on embarking further than just the basics. Titanium can do so much, but most people never learn how to do the really cool stuff.

Appcelerator also pushes hard on the marketing front. Good for them; that's how they make their money. However, this presents the appearance of Titanium being a commercial product than an Open Source project. As a result, many people who are not paying customers treat it like a product that they need to get "support" for from Appcelerator. If I had one wish, it would be for Appcelerator to market Titanium as more of an open "project" than a free product for which they give the source away.

This leads me on to the community issue. The community is not as strong as, for example, node.js, because the majority only pay attention to the "product" side of Titanium, resulting in more complainers than contributors. This is such a disappointment, because it makes me believe that people underestimate how powerful Titanium is; it could do and be so much more if skilled developers added features and fixed bugs rather than complained about things not being absolutely perfect. I mean really... Apple released an Xcode build where location did not work in the simulator for months. If Appcelerator did anything like this, they would be flamed like there was no tomorrow. Don't forget that, unlike Xcode, it's Open source - just fix it yourself! While you're at it, you'll be building yourself a fantastic reputation!

But really, it's like this... When you see a very poorly behaved child in public, is it the childs fault for just being headstrong and rebelious? or the parents, for lack of training?

OK, enough ranting! Working in Developer Relations, I had to deal with that crap a lot without venting any frustration, so I am making the most of this moment! ;)

## Where do I go from here?

I am looking forward to continue on Titanium projects, tools and code examples to help the Community. Let me know if you would like to join me!
