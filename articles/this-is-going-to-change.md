Thoughts in general:

 * develop like the code is going to change, make sure it's changeable, test it, refactor it, fail early, experiment and request feedback
 * deploy like it's going to change, plan for scaling (even if you don't have to), modularize, and automate whenever possible
 * create infrastructure like it's going to change, adopt methods that let you pull out pieces and put in new ones.

Your setup is going to change, program like that's the only thing that will remain constant.
