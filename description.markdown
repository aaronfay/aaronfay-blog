### About Matt Apperson's Blog

This site is designed to outline all that I am learning, and all that I find useful in my work as a Software Engineer. At the moment much of this is around JavaScript as I personaly view this as the language to know for the next few years to come... if that changes, so will the general content of this blog.

This site is powered by a blogging engine written in [node.JS][].
